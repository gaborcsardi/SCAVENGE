\usage{
randomWalk_sparse(
  intM,
  queryCells,
  gamma = 0.05,
  seedWeight = "NO",
  stationary_cutoff = 1e-05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{intM}{a sparse matrix indicating the adjacent matrix
(m x m, where m is the cell number) of cell-to-cell network (M-kNN graph).}

\item{queryCells}{a logical vector indicating seed cells (TRUE)
and non-seed cells (FALSE) with length of m, where m is the cell number.
The length and position are corresponding to intM.}

\item{gamma}{a numeric value indicating the probability of node
restart at each step of random walk.}

\item{seedWeight}{a numeric vector indicating the weight assigned
to each node. "NO" (by default) means
considering weights are equal (no weight).}

\item{stationary_cutoff}{Delta used for determine the stationary state
between any two adjacent iterations.}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of network propagation score with length of m,
where m is the cell number.
}
\description{
Calculate the network propagation score using a set of
seed cells and cell-to-cell graph.

                              queryCells = rownames(mutualknn30)[seed_idx])
